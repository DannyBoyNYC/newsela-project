# Newsela Project 🗞️

A quick project for review. A "miniature" version of some of the work I've done at Barclays.

## Instructions

Github will hose my API key if I push it so you'll have to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary information (provided via email or ping me at daniel.deverell@gmail.com if you don't have it). 

Run `$ yarn` and `$ yarn run dev`.

The only Session worth looking at for now is "Front-End-Summer19".

## Features

* React Hooks 🎯
* Custom Hooks 🎯
* GraphQl endpoints 🎯
* Context API 🎯
* Modals via portals 🎯

To do:
* Maintain state for the selected Class
* Use Apollo for GraphQl?
* Use GraphQL variables 
* Fix in-page links on readme's
* Use CSS in JS, Emotion?
* Add widescreen view (mobile first for now)
