# Newsela

A quick project for review. A "miniature" version of some of the work I've done at Barclays.

The only session worth looking at for now is "Front-End-Summer19".

* React Hooks
* Custom Hooks
* GraphQl endpoints
* Context API

To do:
* Use Apollo for GraphQl?
* Fixed in-page links on readme's
* Add widescreen view
