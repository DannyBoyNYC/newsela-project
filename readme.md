# Newsela Project 🗞️

I cannot release any of my current work so here's a simple project for review.

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Github will hose my API key if I push it so you'll have to copy and paste [this](http://daniel.deverell.com/newsela/shhh.txt) into the `.env` file. (The keys will be deleted after review.)

Run `$ yarn` and `$ yarn run dev` (or `npm` equivalents).

I wanted to play with Hooks, GraphQL and the new Context API. The content is from a bootcamp I run at NYU but **only "Front-End-Summer19"** is structured to conform to the requirements of this demo (descriptions, TOCs etc.).

## Features

* React Hooks 🎯
* Custom Hook 🎯
* GraphQl endpoints 🎯
* Context API 🎯
* useReducer Hook 🎯
* Modals via portals 🎯

To do:
* Maintain state for the selected Class
* Use Apollo for GraphQl?
* Use GraphQL variables 
* Fix in-page links on readme's
* Use CSS in JS, Emotion?
* Add widescreen view (mobile first for now) 

Feel free to email me at daniel.deverell@gmail.com if needed.
